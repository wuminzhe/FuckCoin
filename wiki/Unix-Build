System requirements
--------------------

C++ compilers are memory-hungry. It is recommended to have at least 1 GB of
memory available when compiling FuckCoin Core. With 512MB of memory or less
compilation will take much longer due to swap thrashing.

Dependency Build Instructions: Ubuntu & Debian
----------------------------------------------
Build requirements for CLI:

    sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libdb++-dev libboost-all-dev libqrencode-dev -y

Build requirements for QT GUI wallet:

    sudo apt-get install libminiupnpc-dev mesa-common-dev libgmp-dev libgl1-mesa-dev -y
